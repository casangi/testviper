# TestVIPER
Automated Test Repository for the VIPER Ecosystem

This repository is used to build and run integration tests for the VIPER Ecosystem.
It will install all components and run the available tests in the CI.
Proposed structure for this repository:
- tests
- docs
- docs/user_stories
- ci
- tests/integration
- ......

User stories are saved in Issues with the label "User Story" and linked to the issue that implements
the test. The user stories can also be added to the documentation of the test framework.

## Stages

## Installation

## Execution

## Using PIXI for package management

## CI/CD
A few things to try here.
- GitHub Datadog CI Visibility: for monitoring services
- Git Action Board
- Octolense.com
- Testspace.com

## Central Dashboard for VIPER Ecosystem Integration Tests

### What the Dashboard Should Show
- Test status per component (e.g., AstroVIPER, ToolVIPER, etc.)
- Latest test runs and build status
- Test trends over time (pass/fail rates, flakiness)
- Linked user stories or features
- Links to detailed test reports (e.g., Allure, HTML, logs)
- Metadata: commit ID, test duration, environment

### Testspace
Free account. Unlimited for open-source; includes constraints for private usage.
