If the first query selects out the 'base' data_group, that can confuse functions
like summary. See also issue #450.

The stakeholder tests are probably a better place for a test like this, which uses
open(), query(), summary(), query() again, etc. (not really a unit test). But at
the moment we don't have stakeholder datasets with ""corrected"" or anything else than
""base"".
